## About

<img align="right" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmnfarrell/tkintertable/master/img/logo.png width=150px>

Python uses a GUI library called Tkinter as default. This set of classes allows interactive spreadsheet-style tables to be added into an application. Tkinter is the standard GUI toolkit for python. It is old but still quite popular. There are various libraries that extend Tkinter functionality, such as Pmw, but there is currently no extendable table class for Tkinter. A sample application using these classes is included in the distribution.

> **Note:** This library is also now **Python 3.x** compatible

## Installation

You can install this library: 

```bash
# PIP
pip install tkintertable

# Easy Install
easy_install tkintertable
```

Or if you prefer, you can download this current source using:

```bash
# Git
git clone https://github.com/dmnfarrell/tkintertable.git
```

## Usage

See the [wiki](https://github.com/dmnfarrell/tkintertable/wiki/Usage) for how to use the table in Python.

## API docs

For programmers, the module documentation is at http://dmnfarrell.github.io/tkintertable/index.html. You are encouraged to subclass the TableCanvas class to add new functionality.
